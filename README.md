# Ultrasound Pattern Designer

This app is intended to assist designers in the design of an ultrasonic haptic user interface. This is an invisible, touch-only user interface in mid-air. Designers use the app to set up buttons, sliders or knobs in mid-air to facilitate user interaction.

Designers need to take into account the user's ability to recognise different tactile sensations. Therefore, the app needs to recommend various parameters in response to the designer's needs for interaction.
